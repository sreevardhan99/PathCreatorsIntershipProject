# Path Creators Intership Project

Technologies like Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and JSP were used in the construction of a comprehensive health card administration system that improved staff coordination, appointment scheduling, and patient record management. Privacy was guaranteed via secure login and data encryption. For database management and dynamic web page creation, SQL and JSP were used. A seamless user experience was offered with an intuitive interface made possible by HTML and CSS. This healthcare system streamlines administrative work and improves service delivery.
